                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p>Dinosaur Ancestry: Birds are considered feathered dinosaurs, and modern cladistic analysis confirms their direct lineage from a subgroup of theropod dinosaurs called coelurosaurs. 

Post-Extinction Diversification: After the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period, which wiped out their dinosaurian relatives, modern birds (the avian crown group) underwent a massive diversification, leading to the vast number of species seen today. </p>
<p>Gradual Evolution of Features: The characteristics of birds, such as feathers, wings, and lightweight bodies, evolved incrementally over a long period. For instance, feathers first appeared for insulation in some theropods before developing into structures for flight.

            <p>The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae.[6] Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use.[7] Birds are usually categorised as a biological class in traditional evolutionary taxonomy. Modern phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the clade Theropoda, sometimes with a Linnean rank lower than class, such as subclass[8] or infraclass.[9]

Definition
Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.[10] However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of moder</p>Under the fourth definition Archaeopteryx, traditionally considered one of the earliest members of Aves, is removed from this group, becoming a non-avian dinosaur instead. These proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with the vernacular term "bird" by these researchers.[13]

 Birds

The birds' phylogenetic relationships to major living reptile groups. (The turtles' position is uncertain: Some authorities embed them inside the Archosaurs, with birds and crocodiles.)
Aves can mean all archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles (alternately Avemetatarsalia)
Aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers (alternately Avifilopluma)
Aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly (alternately Avialae)
Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group", in this sense synonymous with Neornithes)
The latter included the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis[42] and the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic.[36] The early euornithians also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithians retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).[43] Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers,[44] which may have replaced the "hind wing" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.[35]

            <h2 id="#Anatomy and physiology">Anatomy and Physiology</h2><hr><p>Most male birds do not have intromittent penises.[89] Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves.[90][91] Its length is thought to be related to sperm competition[92] and it fills with lymphatic fluid instead of blood when erect.[93] When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. Female birds have sperm storage tubules[94] that allow sperm to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species.[95] Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. Most female birds have a single ovary and a single oviduct, both on the left side,[96] but there are exceptions: species in at least 16 different orders of birds have two ovaries. Even these species, however, tend to have a single oviduct.[96] It has been speculated that this might be an adaptation to flight, but males have two testes, and it is also observed that the gonads in both sexes decrease dramatically in size outside the breeding season.[97][98] Also terrestrial birds generally have a single ovary, as does the platypus, an egg-laying mammal. A more likely explanation is that the egg develops a shell while passing through the oviduct over a period of about a day, so that if two eggs were to develop at the same time, there would be a risk to survival.[96] While rare, mostly abortive, parthenogenesis is not unknown in birds and eggs can be diploid, automictic and results in male offspring.[99]

        <p>Feathers: Unique to birds, feathers are crucial for insulation, flight, and species identification. 
Wings: Modified forelimbs adapted for flight in most species, though some are flightless. 
Beaks: Toothless, keratin-covered jaws adapted for various diets and functions, like prehension and thermoregulation. 
Skeleton: A lightweight, hollow, and often fused skeleton with pneumatic bones reduces overall weight for flight. 
Skeletal Supports: A keeled (carinate) sternum provides attachment for powerful flight muscles. A fused pygostyle supports the tail for steering. 
Heart: A large, four-chambered heart efficiently pumps oxygenated blood to meet high metabolic demands. 

Body Cavities: Unlike mammals, birds lack a diaphragm and possess a salomic cavity, which contains air sacs. 
Digestion: The digestive system is adapted to specific diets and includes a muscular gizzard for grinding food. </p>

        <h2>Behaviour</h2><hr><p>The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were the Enantiornithes, or "opposite birds", so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters. While they were the dominant group of avialans during the Cretaceous period, Enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the Mesozoic era.[36][40]


The latter included the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis[42] and the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic.[36] The early euornithians also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithians retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).[43] Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers,[44] which may have replaced the "hind wing" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.[35]

A horn-like brown casque, measuring 13 to 16.9 cm (5.1 to 6.7 in) high, sits atop the head. The bill can range from 9.8 to 19 cm (3.9 to 7.5 in). The plumage is sexually monomorphic, but the female is dominant and larger with a longer casque, larger bill and brighter-coloured bare parts. The juveniles have brown longitudinal striped plumage.[6]
The three-toed feet are thick and powerful, equipped with a lethal dagger-like claw up to 12 cm (4.7 in) on the inner toe. It is perhaps the largest member of the cassowary family and is tied as the third heaviest bird on earth (after the Somali ostrich and the common ostrich), at a maximum size estimated at 85 kg (187 lb) and 190 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall. Normally, this species ranges from 127 to 170 cm (4 ft 2 in to 5 ft 7 in) in length.[6] The height is normally 150 to 180 cm (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 11 in) ; females average 58.5 kg (129 lb), while males average 29 to 34 kg (64–75 lb). The northern cassowary is about the same size on average and is perhaps very mildly less sexually dimorphic than the southern.[6] Most adult birds will weigh between 17 and 70 kg (37 and 154 lb).[8] It is technically the largest Asian bird (since the extinction of the Arabian ostrich) and the largest Australian bird (though the emu may be slightly taller).</p>

        Although subject to ongoing habitat loss (some due to logging), limited range, and overhunting in some areas, the southern cassowary was evaluated as Least concern in 2018 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Other threats include feral animals eating their eggs and roadkill.[1][6] Road-building, feral animals and hunting are the worst of these threats. It has an occurrence range of 396,000 km2 (153,000 sq mi), and between 10,000 and 20,000 birds were estimated in a 2002 study, with between 1,500 and 2,500 in Australia.[1]

The Australian population is listed as Endangered under federal (EPBC Act). Under the Nature Conservation (Animals) Regulation 2020 (Queensland), November 2022 list, the northern population is considered vulnerable, while the southern population remains as endangered.[2] A draft recovery plan to save the species was published by the federal government in June 2023, at which time there were estimated to be around 5,000 individuals in Australia.[18] A study published in Biological Conservation in March 2023 listed 23 species which the authors considered to no longer meet the criteria as threatened species under the EPBC Act, including the Southern cassowary. A 2021 study had shown that extensive reservation had led to recovery of the species, and legislation had prevented the previously rapid loss of habitat. The reason for their assessment was given as "Populations now stable or declining at a rate less than threshold".[19] The team, led by John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University looked at all species listed as threatened under the act in 2000 and 2022.[20]

    <p>Different species of birds suit different types of natural habitat. Although there is much overlap in the resources that different habitats provide (e.g. insect food), some habitats are rich in certain resources. For example, heathlands are often rich in plant species belonging to the family Proteaceae, which tend to have bird-pollinated flowers that are rich in nectar. Heathlands are therefore good places to see honeyeaters. Plants of rainforests often produce fleshy fruits and berries. Rainforests are therefore good places to find fruit-eating pigeons.

Some bird habitats

Heathland

Heathlands usually occur on infertile soils. Around Sydney, they are primarily found near the coast where they are subject to wind and salt spray. Heathlands do not support tall trees: most heathland plants are less than two metres tall. Heathlands are very dense habitats and because most heathland plants are hard-leaved, they form a prickly structure that provides good shelter for small birds. Many heathland plants (e.g. banksias) belong to the plant family Proteaceae, and the flowers of these species are often rich in nectar. Honeyeaters are usually a conspicuous group in heathland habitats.

Woodland

Woodlands are a habitat type dominated by trees, but with a relatively low canopy cover of less than 30%. Eucalypts dominate the canopy and the understorey is relatively open, often containing native grasses. In the Sydney Basin, woodlands used to be common in the western parts which have more fertile soils. However, most of this habitat type has now been cleared, first for farmland, and more recently for housing. This pattern of land-use is common Australia-wide, and birds that naturally occur in woodlands are the most threatened in Australia.

<div id="Ecology">
    <h2>Ecology</h2>
    <p>Avian ecology is the scientific study of birds (avians) in relation to their environment, including their behavior, distribution, interactions, and ecological roles. This field investigates how birds adapt to their surroundings, influenced by factors like habitat, food sources, and climate. Research in avian ecology also addresses the threats birds face, such as habitat loss and urbanization, and aims to develop conservation strategies to protect avian biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide.  
Key Aspects of Avian Ecology
Behavior and Distribution: Understanding how birds migrate, breed, and find resources. 
Habitat and Ecosystems: Analyzing bird communities in various environments, including forests, wetlands, and urban areas. 
Interactions: Studying bird interactions with other species (e.g., pollination, pest control) and their role in ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling. 
Physiological Adaptations: Investigating unique avian features like flight, feathers, and defense mechanisms. 
Conservation: Focusing on the impacts of human activities, like habitat fragmentation and climate change, on bird populations and the development of effective conservation plans.
